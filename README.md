# KDTree
This is implementation of KDTree in java. This is for a university project.
It does not include delete method till now. I may add it later.

Take care that It includes some instance variables of classes that you may not include in your project.
For example: we include class Table with linkedlist of class Page which has 2d array of Strings.
so please read the code carefully.
